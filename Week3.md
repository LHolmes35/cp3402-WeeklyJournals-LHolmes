<h2>Estimated Hours</h2>

1.5 hours

<h2>Content Insights</h2>

Skimming through the basics was a little boring, but I appreciated having it, as I used it as a reminder when creating and publishing content. I found the last segment on building a site from the ground up to be very entertaining. It was interesting, in regards to learning about professional practices and how a staging environment works. 


<h2>Career/Employability/Learning Insights</h2>

It was enjoyable learning about professional development workflows. Also having the base knowledge of tools and workflows that are used in the industry of web designing.
