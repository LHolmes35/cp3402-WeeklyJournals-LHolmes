<h2>Learning Activities and Resources</h2>

This week, we did in-class interviews for our potential assignment groups and I studied the suggested LinkedIn learning content, WordPress Workflows

<h2>Estimated Hours</h2>

1.5 hours + 45 mins for interviews

<h2>Content Insights</h2>

From the WordPress Workflows content, initally skimming through the basics was a little boring, but I appreciated having it, as I used it as a reminder when creating and publishing content. I found the last segment on building a site from the ground up to be very entertaining. It was interesting, in regards to learning about professional practices and how a staging environment works. 

From the interviews, I asked 9 students about their social skills, adaptability/flexibility and their strengths/weaknesses. I asked these question because I see these as valuable skills when working in a team and completing group work. A little more than half of the interviewees had sociallable skills, while others are initally shy before coming into their own, but all had very good abilities to adapt. Each person's strengths, I found, out weighed their weaknesses, and with the right combination, other interviewees could potentially mitigate said weaknesses. 

<h2>Career/Employability/Learning Insights</h2>

It was enjoyable learning about professional development workflows. Also having the base knowledge of tools and workflows that are used in the industry of web designing. For the interviews, I found a few potential candidates to start group assignment with. Each of them exhibit adaptability and great strengths, that I believe will help them with the next assignment, and potentially, their employability.
