<h2>Estimated Hours</h2>

2 hours

<h2>Content Insights</h2>

After studying the content provided by the lecture, the learning content went into further detail about Sass. Learning more about the fundamentals (nesting, mixins, the extend method), the content went into more detail about interpolation, placeholder sections and operators and conditionals. There was also a fun challenge, using maps to create colour options for badges, giving them a base colour and hover colour

<h2>Career/Employability/Learning Insights</h2>

Sass was a challenging topic to tackle, but viable for the web design industry. A language that's more adaptable than CSS in design, I believe it's a great tool to have under your belt and if I decided to go into the profession of web design, it'll give me an advantage. I am thankful that the subject introduces us to it.
