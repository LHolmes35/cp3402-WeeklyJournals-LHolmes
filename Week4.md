<h2>Estimated Hours</h2>

1.2 hours

<h2>Content Insights</h2>

The content this week focused on moving local WordPress sites to live servers. This involved discussions on the Migrate WordPress DB plugin and syncing movie media files using the Media File Addon, if you have the Pro edition. The three steps that were discussed included setting up the target site, migrating plugins/themes and uploading them using FTP, and finally, migrating databases. It also focused on potential errors that can happen during migration, such as the "White Screen of Death" and when manually migrating databases and media file doesn't work. All of the content mentioned was engaging, except when the content mentioned using the Pro version of the plugin. As a student, I try not to spend money when using tools or software for subjects. However, it was cool to see some of the features when you have the upgraded version, as it gave some insight on how to use it, should I need to use the upgraded plugin in the future.

<h2>Career/Employability/Learning Insights</h2>

This course was very insightful, discussing a plugin used in professional CMS, specifically targetting WordPress. The discussions of how the plugin works, to make migrating local WordPress sites, was very helpful. Demonstrations of the Pro plugin were also helpful, giving a brief insight on how to use the upgraded features, should it be required for potential jobs.
