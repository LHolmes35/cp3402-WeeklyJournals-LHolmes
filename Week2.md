<h2>Learning Activities and Resources</h2>

This week I studied the suggested LinkedIn learning content, WordPress Essential Training. I also reviewed tutorials on using Joomla, in relation to this week's practical work.

<h2>Estimated Hours</h2>

5 hours total (2.5 hours on LinkedIn and 2.5 hours on Joomla instruction videos)

<h2>Content Insights</h2>

I enjoyed learning about the different features of WordPress, from its content management systems, to using blocks and learning how to manipulate their properties. I appreciated having an in-depth explanation into a software that is heavily mentioned in this subject. Studying the Joomla was more complex than I thought, with most examples focusing on an earlier model of the software. However, the more recent tutorial helped me with adding more articles and categorizing content.

<h2>Career/Employability/Learning Insights</h2>

Studying two pieces of software has been interesting. I feel great learning the basis of these two industry standard tools. This will allow me to keep expanding my knowledge and skills in both. It also gives me some variety as a web designer, being able to understand and work with tools that are heavily ingrained in this industry.
