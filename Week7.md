<h2>Estimated Hours</h2>

2.5 hours

<h2>Content Insights</h2>

There were many videos for the suggested learning content this week. So, I read through the chapters and selected ones that were also covered in the lecture last week. PHP is a part of the broader web development system, a powerful scripting language that’s relatively easy to learn, especially as it functions like most programming languages. After demonstrations on naming conventions, displaying text, comments, joining strings and arrays, the content dives into using loops and functions.

<h2>Career/Employability/Learning Insights</h2>

PHP is a big part of the web development process, along with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, databases, version control and web servers. Learning multiple coding languages does become easier once you’ve learnt one. Also having knowledge of another language can be a big advantage to the field, especially one as vital as PHP to the web development process.
