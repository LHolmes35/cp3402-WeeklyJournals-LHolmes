<h2>Learning Activities and Recources</h2>

This week I setup a website for a startup business, using bootstrap examples as templates and studied the suggest LinkedIn learning content, Introduction to Web Design and Development.

<h2>Estimated Hours</h2>

I spent 6 hours on making the startup business page and spent 2 hours studying the learning content provided.

<h2>Content Insights</h2>

The LinkedIn learning content was very informative and expanded more on languages and tools that I have used and others that I haven't heard of. Also learning from a teacher with a specialised background in web design about what most of the industry uses. For example, VSCode is the current most popular editor for writing code, however Sublime was the popular choice until falling out of favour. With the website, I found working with bootstrap a little difficult at first, but once I correctly mapped my file destinations, I was having fun recolouring the examples I'd used, as well as make decisions on what I thought was the best opition for a basic startup page. Publishing the website was the other challenge but by following the tutorial of Github pages, I managed to publish the startup site

<h2>Career/Employability/Learning Insights</h2>

Doing this practical has allowed me to jump back into html and CSS, remembering my time coding websites during first year and polishing my skills again, while studying the LinkenIn learning content has given me some great adive on what other languages and tools I can use to further a future career in this field. After this pracitcal, I feel more confident in the subject and the field it is preparing me for.
