<h2>Learning Activities and Resources</h2>

This week I studied the suggested LinkedIn learning content, WordPress: Developing Secure Sites

<h2>Estimated Hours</h2>

2.5 hours

<h2>Content Insights</h2>

I already knew some of the security essentials, as they are best practices in other fields, not just WordPress. However, I now know the best process to improve security using plugins. This included [Antispam Bee](https://wordpress.org/plugins/antispam-bee/), a “spam-fighting” plugin that deletes spam comments based on specified reasons, [Stop User Enumeration](https://wordpress.org/plugins/stop-user-enumeration/), a plugin that helps against a brute force attack by using usernames, and [WP-Ban](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-ban/), a plugin that can enable an admin to ban users based on their IP address, host name and referrer.

<h2>Career/Employability/Learning Insights</h2>

The content this week was presented differently to the previous content given. Instead of a quiz or simply talking about the chosen topic, they provided demo files to follow along. Doing this grabbed my attention better, as I am more of a practical learner. Having the files and following along allowed me to easily retain the information being presented. I never realized that some of the security options and plugins existed. I’m happy to have practiced using them and know this knowledge if I ever become a WordPress on a professional level.
