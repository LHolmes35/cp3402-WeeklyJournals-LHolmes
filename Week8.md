<h2>Learning Activities and Resources</h2>

I’m going take a different approach to studying the learning content this week, WordPress: Building Themes from Scratch Using Underscores. I believe smaller sessions of note taking with a small music break will help me retain more information. 

<h2>Estimated Hours</h2>

4 hours

<h2>Content Insights</h2>

Since I already had a WordPress development environment and learnt about the template generator that was being used, I skipped the first two chapters and focused on the design chapters. I was building the theme, using the content as a demo, setting up the baseline information, settings, and function, then moving on building the header and menus. I borrowed JavaScript from a [previous theme](https://en-au.wordpress.org/themes/twentyseventeen/) to enable dropdown menus and customized it to work with my demo theme. I also used the [Monster Widget](https://wordpress.org/plugins/block-widgets-monster/) plugin to test all widgets and add custom styles to the area and specific widgets.

<h2>Career/Employability/Learning Insights</h2>

For the past few weeks, I’ve tried to get through the learning content quickly, taking it in large chunks. However, I found myself procrastinating during the discussed content and didn’t retain the information after finishing. I decided to study the content in 10–12-minute blocks, with a 4-minute recovery break between each block. I chose 4 minutes as it’s the average length of time for songs I like. I found that I was more attentive this week, when I watched the content in shorter intervals, writing down notes as I go and taking a break after the allocated time.
