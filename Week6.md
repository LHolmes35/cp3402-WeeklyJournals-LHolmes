<h2>Learning Activities and Resources</h2>

This week I studied the suggested LinkedIn learning content, Having daily Stand-Up meetings. This was a chapter of a larger course, Agile at Work: Driving Productive Agile Meetings.

<h2>Content Insights</h2>

The suggested learning content only highlighted one chapter about having daily stand-up meetings for keeping a team synchronized. However, I decided after watch the rest of the course to improve my skills in "Agile Meetings". A stand-up meeting is about self-organizing, with a team standing in a circle at the start of a day, and updates everyone about what is going on. Teams should take no longer than 15 minutes to answer 3 questions. Answers should be short as stand-up meetings shouldn't go over their time limit, otherwise the meeting may go longer than planned. The rest of the content was insightful too, looking at Agile meetings, how they are coordinated and what common pitfalls to avoid.

<h2>Career/Employability/Learning Insights</h2>

These topics were very interesting, as they discuss a type of meeting style that is very common when working with development teams. Each chapter mentions a different example of Agile meetings and allows for a better understanding of how they are supposed to work. I believe this would help prepare any person about to join a development heavy industry.
