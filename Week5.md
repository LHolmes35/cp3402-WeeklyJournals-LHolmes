<h2>Estimated Hours</h2>

2 hours

<h2>Content Insights</h2>

The first chapter of the learning material was a quick setup guide for local WordPress, a code editor and using media content. It’s a good thing to add for new users or users who haven’t used WordPress for a while. However, I found it redundant, as I’ve worked with all these tools, especially local WordPress, constantly for my first few practicals and first assignment. The content then shifts to creating a Child Theme, a new custom theme with the foundation of a base theme, or Parent Theme. The content mentions how to modify CSS files to accomplish these, as well as working with function and template files. Each chapter had a challenge section, which gave a task based on what was taught in the chapter. I found these to be a fun way to reinforce everything that I had learnt.

<h2>Career/Employability/Learning Insights</h2>

Child Themes are a brilliant feature to add to WordPress sites, a custom modified theme that gives websites a more personal touch. I believe learning to create these themes gives a great opportunity for web designers to understand the CSS and PHP that goes into a WordPress site. Potentially, this can allow users to better understand the CMS and become more desirable in a field that uses WordPress as a main tool.
